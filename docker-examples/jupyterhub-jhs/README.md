###streamlit app using jhsingle-native-proxy and DockerSpawner 

##### Streamlit code is in app.py, requirements contains all dependencies, and DockerFile/jupyterhub_config.py files are based on working jupyterhub-test example

#### In this example I am using jhsingle-native-proxy to wrap the streamlit run command in the DockerFile.
